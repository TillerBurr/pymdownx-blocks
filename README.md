# PyMdown Extensions Blocks

These are a collection of blocks for the [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.githug.io/pymdown-extensions) that I find useful.

This project is not affiliated with the PyMdown Extensions project and is currently in a very early stage. Currently, there is only one block: `DirTree`.
